# Introduction
 A software engineer __enthusiastic__ in learning new software technologies and best practices in building stable and scalable applications.
  
 ## Current Interests
 - Distributed systems (Distributed locks, transactions, and CRDTs in particular)
 - Application of microservices architecture in different domains
 - Theories of scalability and its application to distributed systems engineering
 
 ## Core Components that I value the most in Software Design:
 - Stability (Fault-tolerance Design)
 - Scalability (Robust foundations are a must so that systems can be scalable)
 - Code Quality (Clean and readable code formatting)
 - Thorough Testing (Unit testing, integration testing, and End-to-end testing)
 - Developer Experience (Minimize manual and tedious tasks by adopting automation so devs can focus on the core business logic)
 - Logging and Error Monitoring (Errors are mostly unexpected and can always occur so thorough logging must be in place)
 - Proper Documentation (Document important and complex logic so others can understand easily)
