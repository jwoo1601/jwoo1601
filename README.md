# Introduction
 A Full Stack Developer always __enthusiastic__ in learning new software technologies and best practices in building stable and scalable applications.
 
 ## Primary Languages
  C#, Typescript, Java, C++, Python, T-SQL
  
 ## Primary Tech Stacks
  ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core (MVC/Web API 2), Vue, React
  
 ## Current Interests
 - Microservices Architecture
 - CQRS Pattern
 - API Gateways
 - GraphQL
 
 ## Core Components that I value the most in Software Design:
 - Stability (Fault-tolerance Design)
 - Scalability (Robust foundations are a must so that systems can be scalable)
 - Code Quality (Clean and readable code formatting)
 - Thorough Testing (Unit testing, integration testing, and End-to-end testing)
 - Developer Experience (Minimize manual and tedious tasks by adopting automation so devs can focus on the core business logic)
 - Logging and Error Monitoring (Errors are mostly unexpected and can always occur so thorough logging must be in place)
 - Proper Documentation (Document important and complex logic so others can understand easily)
